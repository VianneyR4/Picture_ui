## Deployed app: https://picture-frontend-app.herokuapp.com/

Use this link to quickly test the application with `Integrated API`.

# Picture API

I wanted to build a website(or any other client with User Interface) and web service that will have 
- Users `login`/`register`
- Uploading and showing images. 
- Require `Username(email)` and `Password` parameters for the login 
- Detail for images: `Title` and `Description`. 
- The website should show all the images that users `uploaded` and `sort by date of upload` Ascending(`asc`) and Descending(`desc`). And thatâ€™s it. 
- The website should display them somehow allowing us to `change the sorting`. 
- Also the important part is that Api should not allow posting images to `api` without `authentication`. 


## Project setup

1. Install `nodejs` if you don't have it installed ( check it in the `terminal`, type `$ node -v` or `$ npm -v`)
2. Clone the project from the terminal (type `$ git clone https://github.com/VianneyR4/Picture_ui.git`) or you can download a ZIP file
